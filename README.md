# AoC23
Advent of Code 2023!

## Day 1
This was a bit more challenging than I was expecting for a day 1! It was neat and I brutally golfed my code down w/ nested (nested) comprehensions.

## Day 2
Was a little behind getting started on this, but it was a ton of fun and easier than day 1. It was nice that the input didn't have weird edgecases like on day 1. Might golf this later, but for now leaving as is.
